# Solar Consumption Script to process data from the Powercor myEnergy Energy Dashboard

This script is used to process/format data from the Powercor myEnergy Energy Dashboard for uploading into PVOutput.org

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. Pandas
      pip install pandas

## Usage
1. Register with Powercor by using your meter NMI to gain access to the myEnergy Dashboard.
https://customermeterdata.portal.powercor.com.au/customermeterdata/CADRegoPage

2. Once you have access to the Energy Dashboard, select **Download Data** in the bottom left
3. Change the report type to **Detailed Report (CSV)** and click **Request Meter Data**
4. Download this into the same folder as consumption.py and rename the file to **consumption.csv**
5. Open **consumption.py** and edit the NMI value to your meter.
6. Set the Meter value if that's relevant to your install
7. Set whether you're looking for consumption/generation values
8. Set whether the values are estimated
9. Set the number of lines to import. 14 for free tier, 90 for Donor
10. Go to CMD or Powershell and execute **consumption.py** using "py <path_to_dir>/consumption.py"
11. You should see the results of the script print out the formatted data for a visual check.

```
12. Now that you have your data, open **newconsumption.csv** using your favourite editor. 
    * Copy and paste this data into the **Add Output/Live Loader** (https://pvoutput.org/loadlive.jsp) section on PV Output, using the following settings:
    * Data Format: UE Portal
    * Upload: Consumption
    * Use Net Data: Unchecked
    
13. Select **Load** and your results should be processed.
